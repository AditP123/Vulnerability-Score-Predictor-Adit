# QSC Vulnerability Score Predictor

## Project Description

The **Vulnerability Score Predictor** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict vulnerability scores for users. By utilising supervised machine learning and deep learning models, this project aims to provide an accurate assessment of user vulnerability based on their input descriptions and corresponding threat counts. The backend is deployed using FastAPI on AWS EC2, while the frontend is built using the Streamlit framework and deployed on the Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Features

- **User Input Interface**: Users can enter descriptions of their vulnerabilities and the associated threat counts.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Utilizes supervised learning and deep learning models to predict a vulnerability score based on user inputs.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes the input data to generate meaningful insights and predictions.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Designed to easily incorporate additional data and improve model accuracy over time.
- **Web Deployment**: Backend deployed with FastAPI on AWS EC2 and frontend deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building and training the model.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to package and deploy applications consistently across different environments. 
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building the backend.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the FastAPI app.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the frontend.
- **AWS EC2**: Hosting the backend.
